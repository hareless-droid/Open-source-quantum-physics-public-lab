# The Entropy Experiments Project

## Our Mission
Democratize fundamental physics research through open experimentation, 
transparent data sharing, and merit-based contribution.

## Our Principles

### 1. Anyone Can Contribute
- No degree required
- No institution required  
- Just curiosity + rigor

### 2. All Results Matter
- Null results publish
- Negative results publish
- "Boring" results publish
- Only fraud gets excluded

### 3. Transparency is Non-Negotiable
- All data public
- All code open-source
- All methods documented
- Replication is gold standard

### 4. Credit is Earned, Not Granted
- Tokens track contribution
- Co-authorship by token count
- Reputation from results, not titles

### 5. Science Should Be Free
- No paywalls
- No gatekeepers
- Knowledge belongs to humanity

## Why This Matters

We're testing if:
- Entropy has geometric structure
- Golden ratio optimizes thermodynamic flow
- Dark energy is emergent from entropy
- Vacuum energy can be engineered

But more fundamentally, we're testing:
- Can open science work for frontier physics?
- Can $100 setups produce real discoveries?
- Can GitHub replace journals?

**Join us. Science is too important to be locked behind gates.**
