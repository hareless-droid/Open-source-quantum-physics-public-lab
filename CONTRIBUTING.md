# Contributing to Entropy Experiments Project

## Welcome!

This is an open-source physics research project. Anyone can contribute, regardless of credentials. We value:
- Rigorous methodology
- Transparent data
- Reproducible results
- Honest reporting (null results welcome!)

## How to Contribute

### 1. Run an Experiment

**Easiest:** The $100 Proof of Concept
- See `protocols/basic-drift-test.md` for instructions
- Equipment: ~$100 (speaker, ferrofluid, webcam, beads)
- Time: ~2 hours setup, 30 min per run
- Earn: 10-50 tokens depending on novelty

**Advanced:** Custom protocols
- Propose new tests via GitHub Issues
- Get community feedback
- Run and document
- Earn: 25-100 tokens

### 2. Replicate Someone's Work

**This is HIGHLY VALUED** (replication crisis is real)

- Find an existing run in `data/` folder
- Attempt to reproduce their results
- Document differences (if any)
- Earn: 20 tokens (+ bonus if you find errors)

### 3. Analyze Data

- Grab datasets from `data/` folder
- Look for patterns, anomalies, correlations
- Share visualizations or statistical analysis
- Earn: 15 tokens

### 4. Build Tools

- Tracking software (Python, MATLAB, etc)
- Data analysis scripts
- Hardware improvements (CAD files for mounts, etc)
- Earn: 15-25 tokens

### 5. Peer Review

- Review experiment submissions (Issues labeled "needs-review")
- Check methodology, look for confounds
- Suggest improvements
- Earn: 5 tokens per review

## Submission Format

### For Experiment Runs

Open a new Issue with template "Experiment Run" and include:

**Required:**
- Setup description + photo
- Video of full run (YouTube, Vimeo, or Google Drive link)
- Data file (CSV, Google Sheets, or JSON)
- Frequency, amplitude, duration
- Environmental conditions (temp, humidity if known)

**Optional but helpful:**
- Detailed observations
- Anomalies or unexpected behavior
- Suggestions for improvements

### For Replications

Use "Replication Attempt" template and include:
- Link to original run you're replicating
- Your results vs original (comparison table)
- % difference in key metrics
- Hypothesis for why results match/differ
